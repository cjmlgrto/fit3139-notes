# Scientific Modelling

## The Scientific Method

This is the theme of this entire subject:

1. Observe some events
2. Formulate a question
3. Propose a hypothesis
4. Make a prediction using the hypothesis
5. Test the hypothesis
6. Analyse the results

## Computational Science?

It's the intersection between advances in computing, the information theory bundled with algorithmic problem solving and _science_.

* Computing provides a paradigm shift for science
* Allows scientists to gain insights on problems that are near-impractical to do in the real world — and instead, simulated

## The Modelling Process

1. Analyze the problem
2. Formulate a model
3. Solve the model
4. Verify and validate the solution
5. Maintain the model
