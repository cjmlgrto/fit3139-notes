# FIT3139 â€” Intro to Computational Science
#### Summary Notes by [Carlos Melegrito](http://mlgrto.com)

This collection of semi-organised writings is everything I've noted down during the entire semester. Not only will it serve as my revision notes for my exam, but also for reference in the future. Note that a lot of this content stems from [Monash University](http://www.monash.edu), but most of these writings are of my own.

If you see an issue, just [submit one](https://github.com/cjmlgrto/fit3139-notes/issues/new) or contact me from [my website](http://mlgrto.com/). To use these summary notes, just click any of the links in the contents below.
